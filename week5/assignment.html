        <section>
            <p>This week we talked about another way to unlock more geographic data (<em>geocoding</em>) and a few other ways to represent density using QGIS (<em>heat maps</em> and <em>hex bins</em>). Use this assignment to get familiar with at least one of these and make another map in QGIS before we move to putting maps online next week.</p>
            <p>Please note that this assignment is shorter than other assignments in order to give you more time to work on the <a title="Final Project Proposal" href="https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1365263/assignments/5944940">Final Project Proposal</a>.</p>

            <h2>Geocoding, heat maps, or hex bins</h2>
            <p>Geocoding, heat maps, or hex bins. Pick the one that's most interesting to you and improve one of your previous maps or make a new one. If you change a previous map, compare it with the new one in your response.</p>
            <p>When geocoding you will want a CSV with addresses. This usually comes up naturally, and it can be hard to find a suitable file on purpose. Here are some data sources you might use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Self-Hauler-Registrants/a8wp-rerh/data">Self Hauler Registrants</a> (ignore the latitude and longitude columns)</li>
                <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/HIV-Testing-Locations/72ss-25qh/data">HIV Testing Locations</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For heat maps and hex bins you will need dense point data. Here are some data sources you might find interesting that you're welcome to use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">Inside Airbnb</a> for any city. (Use the file named <strong>listings.csv</strong> for the city you choose.)</li>
                <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/pi5s-9p35#Export">NYC Street Tree Census</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php">USGS Earthquakes</a> (download one of the GeoJSON files on the right)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
            <p>Use the QGIS <strong>Print Composer</strong> to create <strong>one PDF</strong> of your map. Make sure to add map accessories such as legends, titles, and scale bars as appropriate. Refer to your sources as appropriate.</p>
            <p>Finally, include a <strong>short summary</strong> of what you did for this assignment. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>
